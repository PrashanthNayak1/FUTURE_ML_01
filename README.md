This project focuses on building a predictive sales forecasting dashboard for retail businesses using historical transaction data. I cleaned and structured the data, engineered key features like seasonal spikes and monthly averages, and applied time series forecasting models (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost) to predict future sales trends. The insights were visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard, showcasing actual vs. forecasted sales, top-performing products, seasonal variations, and regional breakdowns. The outcome provides retail managers with actionable insights for demand planning, inventory optimization, and strategic decision-making, blending data science, business analytics, and visualization in a real-world context.
